BlockChalk for webOS, v0.5.0
============================

BlockChalk (http://blockchalk.com) is the voice of your neighborhood.  You can
use it to talk to anyone, about anything.  It’s like a virtual graffiti wall, a
community bulletin board, and a poster-covered lightpost, all rolled into one.

Using the GPS in your device, it shows you messages that other people have left
at the place you’re standing, and it lets you leave your own messages, too.
It’s anonymous unless you decide to share more.  You can even privately reply
to other users while still remaining anonymous.

While BlockChalk was originally a aimed at iPhone users, this is an application
using the new BlockChalk API (http://blockchalk.com/developers) to make the
service available on your favorite webOS device.
