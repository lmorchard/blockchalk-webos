                Since this application uses your device's GPS system to
                determine your location, you may experience a short delay 
                upon first starting up.  
            </p>
            <p>
                You'll see a loading spinner while the device gets a fix on
                where you are.
            </p>

                        Request a new user ID from BlockChalk, in case you're

                        After resetting your user ID, you'll no longer
